    <h1>Privacy Policy — Pinax</h1>
    <p class="muted"><strong>Effective date:</strong> 2026-01-11</p>

    <p>
      Pinax is a language flashcard app designed for fast, distraction-free practice.
      This Privacy Policy explains what data Pinax collects and how it is used.
    </p>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Pinax does not collect personal data.</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Pinax does not use analytics, ads, or tracking.</strong></li>
      <li>Your cards and decks are stored <strong>locally on your device</strong>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      Pinax does not collect, transmit, sell, or share personal information.
      We do not require accounts, and we do not run our own servers for user data.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Stored on Your Device</h2>
    <p>
      Pinax stores your flashcards, decks, favourites, and app preferences (such as theme settings)
      <strong>only on your device</strong>, so you can use the app offline.
    </p>

    <h2>Text-to-Speech</h2>
    <p>
      Pinax can read card text aloud using your device’s built-in text-to-speech capabilities.
      The app does not send your card content to our servers.
    </p>

    <h2>Widgets</h2>
    <p>
      Home screen widgets display your decks based on the data stored locally on your device.
      No widget data is sent to us.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      Pinax does not integrate third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking SDKs.
    </p>

    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Pinax is not directed to children under 13 and does not knowingly collect personal data from children.
    </p>

    <h2>Your Choices & Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>
      Because your data stays on your device, you can delete your content within the app (if available),
      or remove the app to delete all locally stored data.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      If Pinax’s privacy practices change, this Privacy Policy may be updated.
      The “Effective date” at the top indicates the latest version.
